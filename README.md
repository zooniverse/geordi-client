# geordi-client
A JavaScript client for the [Geordi](https://github.com/zooniverse/geordi) user-analytics capture engine.

This library simplifies the process of posting an event to Geordi.

To use it in your project, first type:

```
npm install --save zooniverse-geordi-client
```

This will save the Geordi library dependency into your project.

Now, in your `app/index.coffee` file (for hem projects), or your first-loaded JavaScript file (otherwise), load and configure Geordi. This example is in CoffeeScript:

```
# import any needed modules
Subject = require 'models/subject'
User = require 'zooniverse/lib/models/user'

# load the geordi client class
GeordiClient = require 'zooniverse-geordi-client'

# define callback functions that you will pass to Geordi to allow retrieval of current user ID or subject ID
checkZooUserID = ->
  User.current?.zooniverse_id

checkZooSubject = ->
  Subject.current?.zooniverseId

# instantiate the Geordi client into a variable
Geordi = new GeordiClient({
  "server": "staging"
  "projectToken": "serengeti"
  "zooUserIDGetter": checkZooUserID
  "subjectGetter": checkZooSubject
})
```
If necessary, this can be added into a setup file, as shown in Snapshot Serengeti [here](https://github.com/alexbfree/Serengeti/blob/converting-geordi-to-component/app/lib/geordi_and_experiments_setup.coffee). This linked example also shows how to initialize Geordi when using an experiment server such as the [Zooniverse Experiment Server](https://github.com/zooniverse/ZooniverseExperimentServer). 

Once Geordi is loaded into your JavaScript namespace, you can log an event very simply to Geordi as follows in this one-line CoffeeScript example:
```
Geordi.logEvent 'classify'
```
This would log an event of `type` `"classify"`.

The `projectToken` will be set as specified in your configuration, the `userID` and `subjectID` will be automatically retrieved using your provided `zooUserIDGetter` and `subjectGetter` respectively and the `serverURL` and `browserTime` will be set automatically based on the current time and the `location.origin`.

Alternatively, you can pass a parameter object instead of a string, to set multiple parameters at once:
```
Geordi.logEvent {
  'type': 'classify'
  'relatedID': '123-456'
  'subjectID': 'ASG00312'
}
```
This will log an event of `type` `"classify"` with a `relatedID` of `"123-456"` and a `subjectID` of `"ASG00312"`

The [`zooniverse-user-string-getter`](https://github.com/zooniverse/zooniverse-user-string-getter) library will be used to obtain the user ID string to pass to Geordi. 

You can also use this method to log web-application errors or other errors to Geordi, as in this CoffeeScript example:

```
Geordi.logEvent {
  'type': 'error'
  'subjectID': 'ASG00312'
  'errorCode': '409'
  'errorDescription': 'Couldn't load subject'
}
```

Note that you do not have to use `type` `"error"` for errors.

The list of parameters supported by `logEvent` is: `userID`, `subjectID`, `relatedID`, `errorCode`, `errorDescription`, `projectToken`, `serverURL`, `experiment`, `cohort`, `type`, `browserTime` and `data`. These are all required to be non-zero length strings, except for `data` which must be an object, and `browserTime` which should be a Javascript date in number format, corresponding to a date and time no earlier than midnight, September 1st, 2015.
The only required field is `type`. If `type` is omitted, it will be set to `"error"`.

# A note on Experimental Server integration

Geordi and the Geordi Client are also designed to integrate with the [Zooniverse Experiment Server](https://github.com/zooniverse/ZooniverseExperimentServer). This is not currently documented, as the Experimental Server client code is about to undergo a major refactoring.
Refer to the Snapshot Serengeti codebase [here](https://github.com/alexbfree/Serengeti/blob/converting-geordi-to-component/app/lib/geordi_and_experiments_setup.coffee) to see how this can work, or talk to Alex Bowyer for more information.
